Hello, my name is **Mariz Melo**. I am from Brazil. Currently living in San Jose - California and working in Mountain View. I am trying to get **xchema** up and running for next summer. The name is the same as my previous start up company which I opened in Brazil together with my dear friends **Ricardo Amaral** and **Marcelo Vasconcelos**.
    
This blog is my attempt to keep a diary about projects, knowledge base (I keep forgetting things), and a bookmark for useful discoveries around the web.
